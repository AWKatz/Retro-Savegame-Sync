This is an offset of my attempt at making a simple file comparison tool, but I soon found that I had an odd usecase for my retro gaming: "How can I make sure that the game saves on my Office PC can sync to my HTPC or handheld system?". This is another simple tool that will let you compare multiple files and overwrite the oldest with the contents of the newest. Still very early in functionality, but may evolve some more overtime as I brush up on my Python / PySimpleGui.
